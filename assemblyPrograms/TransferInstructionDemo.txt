# This program demonstrates transfer instructions:
# LOAD, STORE and MOVE.

LOAD operand4, r0 #Load operand4 into r0
LOAD operand7, r1
MOVE r1, rCC #Move operand held in r1 to rCC
MOVE r0, r1
STORE r1, location0 #Store operand held in r1 
#to memory address referred to by location0
HALT #To terminate program execution  	
	
operand4: DATA 4
operand7: DATA 7
location0: DATA 0 #Declared to provide a storage
	#destination that doesn't involve
	#overwriting other operands in memory
