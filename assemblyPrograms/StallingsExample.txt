# This program is based on the example on pp.93 of 
# Stallings' Computer Architecture textbook. The 
# textbook example uses an accumulator (AC), which
# will be emulated using r0 and r1 in this
# demonstration as the simulator is RISC-based and
# only LOAD and STORE operations access memory. 

	LOAD operand3, r0
	LOAD operand2, r1 
	ADD r0, r1
	STORE r0, operand2
	HALT #To terminate program execution
	
operand3: DATA 3
operand2: DATA 2
